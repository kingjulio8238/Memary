Any material decline in the business of entities that Uber has ownership interests in could also adversely affect the value of Uber's assets and financial results. The value of these assets is based in part on market valuations, which can be affected by weakened financial markets.

Uber's ability to sell or transfer these assets is contractually limited, and there may not be a market for these securities in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had an adverse impact on Uber's financial results, requiring significant actions such as workforce reductions and changes to pricing models. Economic conditions, including the impact on discretionary consumer spending, can also harm Uber's business and operating results. Increases in costs due to inflation and other factors, such as fuel, food, labor, and energy costs, could adversely affect Uber's operating results.

In March 2022, the company reported growth in both Mobility and Delivery Gross Bookings compared to the same period in 2021. Mobility Gross Bookings increased by 62% year-over-year, primarily due to increased trip volumes as the business recovered from the impacts of COVID-19. Delivery Gross Bookings grew by 15% year-over-year, outpacing Delivery Trip growth, driven by an increase in basket sizes globally due to stay-at-home orders related to COVID-19. Uber's revenue also saw significant growth, up 136% year-over-year, with a Take Rate of 25.9%. This growth was primarily driven by the acquisition of Transplace and favorable accounting changes for the UK Mobility business. However, the company reported a net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc., which included unrealized losses on debt and equity securities. Despite these challenges, Uber's Adjusted EBITDA improved compared to the same period in 2021, with Mobility Adjusted EBITDA profit increasing by 107% and Delivery Adjusted EBITDA profit reaching $30 million. Uber continues to face legal and regulatory risks in the jurisdictions where it operates, which could impact its business and future prospects. The COVID-19 pandemic also continues to have an adverse impact on Uber's operations, with various restrictions affecting its business and reducing the global demand for Mobility rides.
